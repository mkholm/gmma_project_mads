Experiment to see if A1S (or other apparantyl stab subst)  in Laub data could appear stabilising (although real ddG 0 or neutral) by replacing other very destabilisng substitutions at same position

position dependent ddG distributions, positons 2,3,4 approximately Laub, 0 stab, 5 neu, 14 destab, 0 ifs (ddGs: -1, 0, 2, 10 sampled gaussian sd 0.4 repsecetively) position 1 similar but with 4 neu gaussian sampled, one subst fixed at exactly ddGs = 0, follow cahnge in this substs ddGs valuje when scanning the number of destab --> ifs at this positipn.

*
scan ddG displacement more fine grained near 0: observations from v1 point that something is happening there: either A1S effect jump either or or linear correlation effect with hihger ddG displancement: (is effect of interest correlated with ddG displacement magnitude or not)

* 
sample probes from same subst for every iteration (less noise)

* 
more replicates, measuremtns per run, increase resoltuion 



Probe subst always picked from neutral substitutions
