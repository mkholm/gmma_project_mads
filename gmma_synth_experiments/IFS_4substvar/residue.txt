"# Global Multi-Mutant Analysis per position"
"# wt: Wild-type (eGFP) amino acid at position"
"# subst: Attempted substitutions at position"
"# active: Number of active variants with this position mutated"
"# inactive: Number of inactive variants with this position mutated"
"# av: Amino acid in Aequorea victoria (even-wilder type)"
"# sf,do,now: Amino acid in SuperFolderGFP, Do & Boxer split-GFP and Sarkisyan & Kondrashov NowGFP"
"# pdb: Amino acid observed in homologs from the PDB"
"# opt: Optimal amino acid according to GMMA"
"# opt0: Optimal amino acid according to initial fit"
"# ifs: Amino acids (among attempted) that inactivates irreversibly at this position "
"# fit: Amino acids (among attempted) that resulted in an reliable GMMA fit"
"# top: Min rank among substitutions"
"# n_max: Max number of substitutions among active variants"
"# cat: Mutational category of position:"
"#     9   Hot-spot: All stabilizing, no IFS"
"#     8   Half or more stabilizing, no IFS"
"#     7   Less than half stabilizing and possible some IFS but most variant are active"
"#     6   At lest one stabilizing substitution"
"#     5   Nothing is known"
"#     4   No fitted substitutions but some IFS"
"#     3   Nothing is known but few active"
"#     2   Less than half are very destabilizing and some variants are active"
"#     1   Not all very destabilizing"
"#     0   Conserved: All fitted substitutions are very detabilizing"
